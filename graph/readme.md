graph is a data-strucre 

vertices represent a point in graph ds.

-- 2 types of graph is exist 

    1. Directed Graph
    2. Undirected Graph

1. Undirected Graph 

degre of graph = number of edges

sum of degree=2 * |E|
Maximum number of edges=|v| * (|v| - 1) / 2


2. Directed Graph

degre of graph = number of edges

-- in directed graph 2 type of degree is available

    1. indegree
    2. outdegree

    sum of degree=|E|
    sum of outdegre=|E|

    maximum number of edges=|v|*(|v| - 1)

assume vertices=v
wailk: v1 v2 v4 v3
path: v1 v2 v4
cycle:there exists a walk that begins and ends with same vertices


-- BFS (Breadth First Search)

BFS is graph traversal algorithm
