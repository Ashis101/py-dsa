# Applications of Linkdlist

1.worst case insertion at the end and begining are theta(1)

2.worst case deletion from the begining is theta(1)

3.insertion and deletions in the middle are theta(1) ifwe have reference to the previous node

4.round robin implemetion

5.merging two sorted linked lists is faster than arrays.

6.implmention of simple memory manager where we need to link free blocks

7.easier implemention of queue and deque data structures
